## Bugs
* graphs: constant graph in percentage view looks wrong

* stages: archived stages look messed up

* overview: crashes when graphs do not have enough data

## Features
* add events page for major life events e.g. travel plans, sizable one-off gifts to children etc.
* assets page

* overview: improve rendering performance by using canvas?


* Add real estate as an investment type
