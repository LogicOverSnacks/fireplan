  Tab for each plan
  Overall settings

  Settings lets you setup:
    * graphs of historical stock price, gold price, bonds, etc. - user can add their own graphs too
    * people - the ages and life expectancy of the people, usually will be 1 person or a couple
    * current assets & investments

  Each plan tab displays:
    * life stages with income & expenses for each person (option to combine expenses?)
    *


  Monetize by:
    * allowing multiple settings to be setup : very useful for professional financial planners
    * allow backing up settings to disk/cloud (needs encryption!)
    * "clients" page where you can choose which client to view

 -->

<!--
  Graph with:
    * Net worth
    * Investment nest egg
    * Expenditures: columns showing money spent (user can change the smoothing level e.g. day, month, year)


    life expectancy should be configurable with mean & variance

    example of stages: now, kids start school, kids leave home, retirement, state pension available

    models for: inflation, bonds, stocks

    allow option of varying allocation to cash/bonds/stocks, during market downturn only draw money from the cash pile to prevent selling stocks. Have a variable for cash buffer e.g. 5 years of expenses
